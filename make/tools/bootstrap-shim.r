    Purpose: {
        Ren-C "officially" supports two executables for doing a bootstrap
        build.  One is a frozen "stable" version (`8994d23`) which was
        committed circa Dec-2018:

        https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/dcc4cd03796ba2a422310b535cf01d2d11e545af

        The only other executable that is guaranteed to work is the *current*
        build.  This is ensured by doing a two-step build in the continuous
        integration, where 8994d23 is used to make the first one, and then
        the build is started over using that product.

        This shim is for 8994d23, in order to bring it up to compatibility
        for any new features used in the bootstrap code that were introduced
        since it was created.  This is facilitated by Ren-C's compositional
        operations, like ADAPT, CHAIN, SPECIALIZE, and ENCLOSE.
    }

; The snapshotted Ren-C existed right before <blank> was legal to mark an
; argument as meaning a function returns null if that argument is blank.
; See if this causes an error, and if so assume it's the old Ren-C, not a
; new one...?
;
; What this really means is that we are only catering the shim code to the
; snapshot.  (It would be possible to rig up shim code for pretty much any
; specific other version if push came to shove, but it would be work for no
; obvious reward.)
