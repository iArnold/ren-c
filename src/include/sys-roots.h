// API REBVALs live in singular arrays (which fit inside a REBSER node, that
// is the size of 2 REBVALs).  But they aren't kept alive by references from
// other values, like the way that a REBARR used by a BLOCK! is kept alive.
// They are kept alive by being roots (currently implemented with a flag
// NODE_FLAG_ROOT, but it could also mean living in a distinct pool from
// other series nodes).
//
// The API value content is in the single cell, with LINK().owner holding
// a REBCTX* of the FRAME! that controls its lifetime, or EMPTY_ARRAY.  This
// link field exists in the pointer immediately prior to the REBVAL*, which
// means it can be sniffed as a REBNOD* and distinguished from handles that
// were given back with rebMalloc(), so routines can discern them.
//
// MISC() is currently unused, but could serve as a reference count or other
// purpose.  It's not particularly necessary to have API handles use REBSER
// nodes--though the 2*sizeof(REBVAL) provides some optimality, and it
// means that REBSER nodes can be recycled for more purposes.  But it would
// potentially be better to have them in their own pools, because being
// roots could be discovered without a "pre-pass" in the GC.
//


//=//// SINGULAR_FLAG_API_RELEASE /////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The rebT() function can be used with an API handle to tell a variadic
// function to release that handle after encountering it.
//
// !!! API handles are singular arrays, because there is already a stake in
// making them efficient.  However it means they have to share header and
// info bits, when most are not applicable to them.  This is a tradeoff, and
// contention for bits may become an issue in the future.

// Rather than have LINK() and MISC() fields used to distinguish an API
// handle like an INTEGER! from something like a rebEval(), a flag helps
// keep those free for different purposes.
